Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   I use windows as my operating system and i already had it installed in my pc and here is its proof Edition	Windows 10 Pro
Version	22H2
Installed on	‎3/‎11/‎2024
OS build	19045.4412
Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.19056.1000.0.


2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   installed the visual studio code through one of the online sessions and here is the step to step one go to the Visual Studio Code website using a browser.Two is Download for Windows button or your operating system if youre using a different one like macos.Three when the download is complete the VS Code icon will appear in your downloads folder and click on the installer icon to begin the installation process,accept the terms and conditions,choose the default location for installation Click next and check the box to create a desktop icon.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   Download the latest version of Git and choose the 64/32 bit version. After the file is downloaded, install it in the system. Once installed, select Launch the Git Bash, then click on finish. The Git Bash is now launched.Use the following commands first one can know the version of the git by using the git --version,use  git config --help to get help,create a local directory using mkdir test and cd test and many other commands.one has to link the git ti their git hub account after signing up.you use commands to link this two.An example of a repository i did for learning purpose is https://github.com/Naomikomu/dem.git

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
 Go to the Python download page for your operating system
Select a stable version of Python 3
Choose the correct link for your device, such as Windows installer (64-bit) or Windows installer (32-bit)
Download the executable file
Locate the downloaded installer file, usually in your Downloads folder
Double-click the file to run the installer
If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes to allow the installation
On the installer's welcome screen, you can choose to Install Now or Customize installation
After the installation process completes, click Finish


5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

Go to the MySQL website
Select Downloads
Select MySQL Installer for Windows
Choose the version that's compatible with your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit)
Click Execute to start the download
Open the installer and click Yes when prompted for permission
Select Custom as the setup type
Check the requirements
Configure the server
Connect to the server
Apply the configuration
Click Finish
Choose whether to start the Workbench and Shell 

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    During my linking of git to github i had a problem of using the wrong commands hence getting troubles but i copied the problem and pasted it in an LLM and going through tutorials on how to link the two made the setting up easier.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
